This is my attempt at all Windows Tweaks I've come across. Weather this is Open Source Projects, one off scripts that are helpful or even applications built by Microsoft that can extend functionality.

After learning of so many of them, and having the list get longer and longer as developers don't like the decisions Microsoft makes, this is an easy place I can save all of them.
